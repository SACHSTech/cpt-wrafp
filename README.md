# HDI Data Visualization

* Data Set Used: https://ourworldindata.org/human-development-index 

I am using this dataset in order to better understand the trends of human development and to showcase how society and technology is evolving. The collection of data was around ~3,000 lines and challenged me to properly learn FileReader and to convert values into data structures. However, after many hours of no progress trying to figure out how to set it up properly, I decided to reduce the complexity of my code and display the data manually without extra functionality.

I selected this data as I am very interested in political/historical things and was curious about the specific data. I value equality a lot and it is very intriguing to see the differences in opportunity in places around the world. I think the selection of countries I picked to showcase are interesting and shows how not every country develops at the same time/same way, but that there is an general upward trajectory.
