# HDI Data Visualization

* Data Set Used: https://ourworldindata.org/human-development-index 

I am using this dataset in order to better understand the trends of human development and to showcase how society and technology is evolving. The collection of data was around ~3000 lines and challenged me to properly learn FileReader and to convert values into data structures. However, after many hours of no progress trying to figure out how to set it up properly, I decided to reduce the complexity of my code and display the data manually without extra functionality.

I selected this data as I am very interested in socioeconomical/political/historical things and was curious about the specific data. I think the selection of countries I picked to showcase are interesting and show how not every country develops at the same time/same way, but that there is an upward trajectory.
